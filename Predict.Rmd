#This function read in the training set and quiz set in csv format by read.csv function in r. We clean up the data by deleting the following:-
# 1) Columns with zero variance, 2) Columns with NA and blank spaces more than a threshold selected by the user, 3) columns 1-6 as the name of users
# row numbers, time stamps etc should have no bearing to the prediction.
# The clean up data is then randomly divided into a training set and a cross validation test set to predict the outcome variable "classe" with all the
# rest of the columns/features as predictors
# As this is a classification problem which works best with regularized logistic regression or random forest models, the random forest model of the caret
# package is use for prediction purposes. After training the model on the train set, it is ran on the test set for cross validation to test for accuracy
# The final model is then use to predict the classe in 20 cases.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
